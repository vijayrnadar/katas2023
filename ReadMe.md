#	Motivation
A new startup wants to build the next generation online trip management dashboard to allow travelers to see all of their existing reservations organized by trip either online (web) 
or through their mobile device.
# 2. Bussiness Requirement 
- Poll email looking for travel-related emails
- Filter and whitelist certain emails
- The system must interface with the agencyâ€™s existing airline, hotel, and car rental interface system to update travel details (delays, cancellations, updates, gate changes, etc.). Updates must be in the app within 5 minutes of an update (better than the competition)
- Customers should be able to add, update, or delete existing reservations manually as well.
- Items in the dashboard should be able to be 
grouped by trip, and once the trip is complete, the 
items should automatically be removed from the 
dashboard.
- Users should also be able to share their trip 
information by interfacing with standard social 
media sites or allowing targeted people to view 
your trip.
- Richest user interface possible across all deployment platforms requirements
- Provide end-of-year summary reports for users with a wide range of metrics about their travel usage
- Road Warrior gathers analytical data from users 
trips for various purposes 
- travel trends, locations, airline and hotel vendor preferences, cancellation and update frequency, and so on
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing travel systems (i.e, SABRE, APOLLO)
- Must integrate with preferred travel agency for quick problem resolution (help me!)
- Must work internationally
  
# 3. Technical Requirement 
- Million active users/week
- Total users: 15 million (user accounts)
Users must be able to access the system at all times (max 5 minutes per month of unplanned downtime)
- Travel updates must be presented in the app within 5 minutes of generation by the source 
- Response time from web (800ms) and mobile (First-contentful paint of under 1.4 sec)

# 7. Architecture Quality Attributes
## 7.1. Two million active users/week - Scalability 
Architecture needs to be capable to scale as the number of users grow and active. It requires careful planning and infrastructure design. 

## 7.2. Access the system at all times - Availability 
Ensuring availability in a system means that the system should be accessible and operational at all times, without significant interruptions or downtime. Availability is one of the key attributes of a reliable and robust system, and it is critical for providing a seamless user experience and meeting service level agreements (SLAs)

## 7.3. Travel updates within 5 minutes - Responsiveness
Responsiveness is a key quality attribute in system architecture that focuses on delivering timely and quick responses to user requests or system events.

## 7.4. Response time from web (800ms) - Usability and User Experience (UX)
A response time of 800 milliseconds for a web application represents a well-optimized and responsive system. It reflects the system's ability to swiftly process incoming requests, retrieve data, execute necessary operations, and deliver the desired content back to users.

## 7.5. Richest user interface possible across all deployment platforms - Performance
Usability and UX address the quality of the user interface and the overall user experience, ensuring that users can interact with the system effectively and enjoy a positive, intuitive, and engaging experience
## 7.6. Autentication
OAuth flow for authetication  the system and components. It works well with centralized and distributed architecture


# 8. Architecture Decision Records

##  8.1. Architectural Structures and Styles

### 8.1.1. Status 
Proposed

### 8.1.2. Context

The reservation sytsem spread across multiple domain like airline, hotel and car rental, also system needs to be scalable. We are looking for a  architectural structure of the system that promotes a clear understanding of our business domain and aligns software design with business goals.
 
### 8.1.3. Decision
After careful evaluation and consideration, we have decided to adopt Domain-Driven Design (DDD) as our architectural structure of the system. This decision is based on the following factors:
- DDD encourages a close collaboration between domain experts and developers, ensuring that our software reflects the real-world business domain. This alignment with business goals
-  DDD promotes modularization, making our system more scalable and maintainable as it grows.
- DDD emphasizes the use of a common language that bridges the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders
- DDD's focus on bounded contexts and aggregates allows us to build and evolve components of our system independently
- Allowing teams to pinpoint exactly the area of the system that requires the change and also troubleshoot issue
- Changes in code are isolated to only one small part of the system
- Plug-in components are used to extend the application by adding functionality
- 
### 8.1.4. Consequences

The decision to adopt Domain-Driven Design (DDD) has the following consequences:
- Team members may need to invest time in learning DDD concepts and practices
- We may need to invest in tools and frameworks that support DDD practices
- Need to organize cross-functional teams with specialization


##   8.2. Business logic and Infrastructural pattern

### 8.2.1. Status 
Proposed

### 8.2.2. Context

The system needs to be scalable and low latency. Reservation system spread accorss multiple domain and compelxity will grow. We are looking for an architectural pattern to improve performance of query execution and there by latency will be improved.
 
### 8.2.3. Decision

After careful evaluation and consideration, we have decided to adopt the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) architectural pattern as part of our system architecture. This decision is based on the following factors:
- CQRS devotes a single model to executing operations that modify the systemâ€™s state (system commands). 
- Syncronous Projecting Read Models
![Alt text](ProjectionEngineReadModel.png)
  - Improves the read query performance and overall application performance
  - The synchronous projection method makes it trivial to add new projections and regenerate existing ones from scratch. 
- CQRS allows us to scale the command and query sides independently. This is crucial for handling increasing workloads and ensuring optimal system performance.
- To leverage perfrmance benifit of search index for full text search, and prerendered flat files for fast data retrieval
### 8.2.4. Consequences

The decision to adopt CQRS has the following consequences:
- Team members may need to acquire knowledge and expertise in CQRS concepts, event sourcing, and related technologies.


##  8.3. Codebase pattern

### 8.3.1. Status 
Proposed

### 8.3.2. Context

 Reservation system spread accorss multiple domain and compelxity will grow. Different teams will create different code base style and pattern. Need to bring uniformity across projects and team
 
### 8.3.3. Decision

After careful evaluation and consideration, we have decided to adopt the Ports and Adapter architecture pattern architectural pattern as part of our system architecture. This decision is based on the following factors:
- Ports & adapters architecture a perfect fit for business logic implemented with the domain model pattern. 
- The architecture promotes testability by allowing us to isolate components (ports) and provide test implementations (adapters) for various interfaces

### 8.3.4. Consequences

The decision to adopt CQRS has the following consequences:
- Team members may need to acquire knowledge and expertise in Ports & adapters architecture.

##   8.4. Codebase Pattern

### 8.4.1. Status 
Proposed

### 8.4.2. Context

 Reservation system spread accorss multiple domain and compelxity will grow. Different teams will create different code base style and pattern. Need to bring uniformity across projects and team
 
### 8.4.3. Decision

After careful evaluation and consideration, we have decided to adopt the Ports and Adapter architecture pattern architectural pattern as part of our system architecture. This decision is based on the following factors:
- Ports & adapters architecture a perfect fit for business logic implemented with the domain model pattern. 
- The architecture promotes testability by allowing us to isolate components (ports) and provide test implementations (adapters) for various interfaces

### 8.4.4. Consequences

The decision to adopt CQRS has the following consequences:
- Team members may need to acquire knowledge and expertise in Ports & adapters architecture.


##   8.5. Data Ownership

### 8.5.1. Status 
Proposed

### 8.5.2. Context

 Reservation system spread accorss multiple domain and growing data and team structure the data maintenance and  structure will be a nightmare with different teams 
 
### 8.5.3. Decision

After careful evaluation and consideration, we have decided to adopt Single Ownership Data principle. This decision is based on the following factors:
- Single table ownership occurs when only one service writes to a table. 
- Preserve bounded context
- Clear defined resposnibility of service and data

### 8.5.4. Consequences

The decision to adopt Single reponsibility principle has the following consequences:
- Table might have to split in case of future enhancement
- The type of communication protocol (synchronous versus asynchronous) also matters when splitting a table
